# ZOMATO-eda-lstm-and-recommendation

This project analyzes and builds a recommendation system using the **Zomato dataset** from Kaggle. The project includes data exploration, data cleaning, and the development of predictive models.

## Notebooks

### 1. Zomato Restaurant Recommendation

In this notebook, we explore and preprocess the Zomato dataset and build a recommendation system for restaurants.

#### Key Steps:
- Data Loading and Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building a Recommendation System

### 2. Zomato Complete EDA and LSTM Model

This notebook dives deeper into the dataset with extensive EDA and builds a predictive model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks.

#### Key Steps:
- Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Building and Evaluating LSTM Model
